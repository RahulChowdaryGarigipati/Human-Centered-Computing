abstract = {We present new alternative interfaces for zooming out on a mobile device: Bounce Back
and Force Zoom. These interfaces are designed to be used with a single hand. They
use a pressure-sensitive multitouch technology in which the pressure itself is used
to zoom. Bounce Back senses the intensity of pressure while the user is pressing down
on the display. When the user releases his or her finger, the view is bounced back
to zoom out. Force Zoom also senses the intensity of pressure, and the zoom level
is associated with this intensity. When the user presses down on the display, the
view is scaled back according to the intensity of the pressure. We conducted a user
study to investigate the efficiency and usability of our interfaces by comparing with
previous pressure-sensitive zooming interface and Google Maps zooming interface as
a baseline. Results showed that Bounce Back and Force Zoom was evaluated as significantly
superior to that of previous research; number of operations was significantly lower
than default mobile Google Maps interface and previous research.},
